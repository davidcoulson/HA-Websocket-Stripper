# WebSocket Stripper

Serves your real Home Assistant dashboards but only forwards the entities each dashboard
uses, so kiosk/wall-panel pages load fast on large instances — with no loss of fidelity
(it's the real frontend and real cards).

## Configuration

| Option | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `dashboards` | list of strings | Dashboard `url_path`s to serve (e.g. `fridge-status`). The forwarded entity set is the **union** of all of them, so you can navigate between them. Find a dashboard's `url_path` in Settings → Dashboards. |
| `always_forward` | list | Entities to forward even if no listed dashboard uses them. Each item is a literal `entity_id` or a `/regex/` (matched against all entities). |
| `never_forward` | list | Entities to never forward. Applied last — **wins** over `always_forward` and dashboard detection. Literal or `/regex/`. |
| `strip_entities` | bool | `true` (default) strips the websocket to the allowlist. `false` = full passthrough (for A/B comparison). |
| `port` | int | Port the add-on listens on (default `8099`). Because it runs with `host_network: true`, this option is how you move it off `8099` — the **Network** tab can't remap a host-network port. Change it if `8099` collides with another add-on (e.g. Zigbee2MQTT). |
| `ha_base` | string | Optional. Override the Home Assistant base URL the add-on proxies to (default `http://homeassistant:8123`). Set this if `host_network` is on and the internal `homeassistant` hostname doesn't resolve — e.g. `http://192.168.4.2:8123`. |
| `allow_ws_url` | string | Optional. Override the websocket URL used once at startup to precompute the allowlist (default `ws://supervisor/core/websocket`). Set if `supervisor` doesn't resolve under `host_network` — e.g. `ws://192.168.4.2:8123/api/websocket` (also requires a token via `ALLOW_TOKEN`). |

### Example

```yaml
dashboards:
  - fridge-status
  - home-status
  - dashboard-deck
always_forward:
  - "/^sun\\./"
  - person.gabriel
never_forward:
  - "/_battery$/"
strip_entities: true
```

Regex entries are slash-wrapped with optional flags, e.g. `"/_motion$/i"`. In YAML,
backslashes must be escaped (`"\\."`).

## Usage

After starting, browse to `http://<ha-host>:8099/<dashboard-url-path>`, e.g.
`http://homeassistant.local:8099/fridge-status`. Point your kiosk browser at that URL.

> **Port:** because this add-on runs with `host_network: true` (see the tradeoff below),
> it binds directly on the host and the **Network** tab cannot remap it. If `8099` collides
> with another add-on (e.g. Zigbee2MQTT), set the `port` option instead.

The first visit prompts a normal HA login (it's a different origin); after that it's your
real dashboard.

### Trusted-network (password-less) kiosk login

To let a kiosk skip the password via HA's `trusted_networks` auth provider, the add-on
must run with `host_network: true` (the default in this add-on). Without it, Docker
rewrites every client to the gateway IP (`172.30.32.1`) before the proxy sees it, so the
kiosk's real LAN IP never reaches HA and `trusted_networks` can't match it.

On the HA side (`configuration.yaml`), the request now arrives from the **host itself**:

```yaml
http:
  use_x_forwarded_for: true
  trusted_proxies:
    - 127.0.0.1
    - ::1
    # add the host's own LAN IP too if the add-on reaches HA via it, e.g. 192.168.4.2
homeassistant:
  auth_providers:
    - type: trusted_networks
      trusted_networks:
        - 192.168.5.0/24      # the kiosk's subnet
      allow_bypass_login: true
    - type: homeassistant     # keep this or you lose password login entirely
```

Then `ha core restart` (a full restart — `http:` changes need it).

### Why `host_network` is on — and what it costs

This add-on ships with `host_network: true` on purpose. That single flag is a tradeoff, so
here is exactly what you get and what you give up.

**What it buys you.** The add-on shares the host's network stack instead of Docker's
bridged network, so HA sees the **browser's real LAN IP**. That is the *only* clean way to
make the trusted-network (password-less) kiosk login above work: in bridged mode Docker
NATs every client to the gateway `172.30.32.1` before the proxy sees it, so the kiosk's
real IP never reaches HA and `trusted_networks` can't match it.

**What it costs.**

- **The port is rigid.** It binds `:8099` on the host directly; the **Network** tab can't
  remap it, so a clash with another add-on on `8099` can't be fixed there (see #6 above).
- **Internal DNS can break.** The `homeassistant` and `supervisor` hostnames may not
  resolve in host-network mode. If startup fails, pin them to IPs with the `ha_base` and
  `allow_ws_url` options (e.g. `ha_base: http://192.168.4.2:8123`).
- **HA sees the request from the host itself**, so `trusted_proxies` must list
  `127.0.0.1`/`::1` (and optionally the host LAN IP) — not the Docker gateway subnet.

**If you don't need password-less-by-IP login**, none of the above helps you and bridged
mode is simpler (free port remapping, working DNS). Some users run a locally-modified copy
with `host_network: false` for exactly that reason. It is not exposed as an option because
`host_network` is a build-time add-on setting, not a runtime one — changing it means
editing `config.yaml` and rebuilding. If you log in normally (or with a token) and don't
rely on trusted-network auto-login, that's a reasonable local change; you then trim the
port via the Network tab as usual. The default stays `true` so the documented kiosk login
keeps working out of the box.

## Statistics panel

The add-on registers an Ingress panel, so once it is running there is a **Stripper** entry in
the Home Assistant sidebar. (If it does not appear, turn on *Show in sidebar* on the add-on's
own page — Supervisor stores that flag per install, and it stays off for add-ons that gained
Ingress in an update.)

The panel shows:

- **clients connected right now** — address, how many entities each is subscribed to, how long
  it has been connected, and its live update throughput;
- **what got trimmed** — the number of times each payload was trimmed, the size Home Assistant
  sent, the size the browser received, and the difference;
- **allowlist size against instance size**, so "391 of 9,751" is visible at a glance.

The same data is JSON at `http://<host>:8100/stats.json`. It is read-only and unauthenticated
on the local port, so treat it as you would the add-on's own port.

The port is not an add-on option, on purpose. Supervisor proxies ingress to the `ingress_port`
declared in `config.yaml`, and that field cannot be changed through the add-on options API — so
an option you could edit would leave Supervisor proxying the sidebar to a port nothing is
listening on, which fails as a bare 502. Instead the add-on asks Supervisor which port it was
assigned and binds exactly that, so the two can never disagree. The port it chose is in the
first lines of the add-on log. (This also means `ingress_port: 0` — Supervisor allocating a
port dynamically from its own reserved range — works without any code change, if 8100 ever
turns out to collide in practice.) A `rest` sensor pointed at
it will graph any of this over time:

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: rest
    name: Stripper entities served
    resource: http://homeassistant.local:8100/stats.json
    value_template: "{{ value_json.allowlist.union }}"
    json_attributes_path: "$.savings"
    json_attributes: [before, after, savedPct]
```

### What the numbers mean

Sizes are **uncompressed payload** — the bytes the browser has to parse. Fewer bytes than that
cross the wire, because the websocket negotiates compression.

`get_states` reports a genuine before/after: the proxy holds Home Assistant's full answer and
its own trimmed answer in the same function, so the saving is a subtraction rather than an
estimate.

**Live update traffic is throughput, not a saving.** Home Assistant filters the event stream
server-side from the `entity_ids` this add-on injects, so the untrimmed volume never exists
anywhere and cannot be measured. Reporting a saving there would mean inventing a
counterfactual. If you want that comparison, run once with `strip_entities: false` and compare
the two throughput figures.

A connection younger than a minute reports no rate at all rather than extrapolating its
opening burst — the panel shows "—" until there is a full minute to divide by.

## Notes & limits

- Trimming only affects the **entity** stream (`get_states` / `subscribe_entities`).
  Registries, lovelace config, translations, and the frontend JS bundles pass through.
- Cards referencing entities outside the allowlist will show "unavailable". The allowlist
  is computed generously (all views + template-referenced ids), but if something's
  missing add it via `always_forward`.
- The allowlist is computed at startup and **rebuilt live** when a dashboard is saved (or a
  registry changes) — no restart needed. When the rebuild **adds** entities, open dashboard
  connections are dropped so the frontend reconnects and picks them up on its own; no manual
  kiosk reload. (Removals don't churn open connections — carrying a few entities you no
  longer need is harmless.) Adding a whole new dashboard to `dashboards` still needs a
  restart, since options are read at boot.

### auto-entities filter support

Filter values accept the same forms auto-entities itself accepts — an exact id, a `*` glob
(anchored), or a `/regex/` (**not** auto-anchored; include your own `^`/`$`) — on every key
below, not just `entity_id`.

| Key | Resolved how |
|---|---|
| `entity_id`, `domain` | matched directly |
| `area`, `label`, `device`, `integration` | via the HA registries (matches id **or** name) |
| `name` | against `friendly_name` |
| `group` | expands to the group's members |
| `template` | rendered through HA, then real entity ids are taken from the output |
| `state`, `attributes` | deliberately **over-included** — an entity that doesn't match right now is still forwarded, so the card can show it when it later does |

Entities are also pulled in **transitively through groups**: if a card names a group (or
expands one client-side, e.g. `show_group_members`), its members are allowlisted even though
they appear nowhere in the dashboard config.

Still unsupported, and treated as matching nothing: `not`, `and`, `or`, `floor`,
`device_manufacturer`, `device_model`, `last_changed`. If you rely on one of these, list the
entities in `always_forward` and open an issue.
- **Restarting Home Assistant is safe.** The add-on keeps running and waits: HTTP returns
  502 and `/api/websocket` is refused while core is down, then it reconnects, rebuilds the
  allowlist, and open dashboards recover on their own. The same applies at host boot, when
  the add-on starts before core is listening.
- Navigating (via the HA sidebar) to a dashboard **not** in `dashboards` will show its
  entities as unavailable; add it to the list if you want it served too.
