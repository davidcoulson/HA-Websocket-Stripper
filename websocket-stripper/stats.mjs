// Runtime statistics for the add-on's Ingress panel and its JSON API.
//
// Why this exists: until now the ONLY evidence the add-on was doing anything was the log,
// which you read when something already looks wrong. Everything below is counted at the
// points where the proxy already computes a before/after, so collecting it is close to free.
//
// An important honesty constraint runs through this file. Three of the four trims have a
// genuine, measurable before/after — the proxy holds HA's full answer and its own trimmed
// answer in the same function, so "saved" is a subtraction, not a model. The event stream
// does NOT: HA filters it server-side from the entity_ids we injected, so the untrimmed
// volume never exists anywhere and cannot be measured. It is therefore reported as
// throughput ("what this client is receiving"), never as a saving. Inventing a counterfactual
// there would make the headline number bigger and make the panel a liar.
//
// All byte counts are UNCOMPRESSED payload — what the browser must parse. With
// compress_websocket on, fewer bytes than this cross the wire.
