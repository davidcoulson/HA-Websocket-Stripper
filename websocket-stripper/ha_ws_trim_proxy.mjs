// ha_ws_trim_proxy.mjs — reverse proxy that serves the REAL Home Assistant frontend
// but trims the entity firehose so a kiosk dashboard loads fast with full fidelity.
//
// It proxies all HTTP straight through to HA (frontend bundles, auth, registries,
// lovelace config, custom-card resources — untouched). All websocket upgrades also pass
// through EXCEPT /api/websocket, which is the only connection it intercepts:
//   * subscribe_entities (no filter)  -> inject entity_ids = the dashboards' allowlist,
//                                         so HA streams only those entities.
//   * get_states result               -> filtered to the allowlist.
// Everything else (auth handshake, registries, config, events) passes through, so the
// real frontend renders your real cards — just without the all-entities firehose.
//
// The allowlist is computed at startup from each dashboard's lovelace/config (walked by
// ./lovelace_extract.mjs), unioned across all configured dashboards, then rebuilt live
// whenever HA fires `lovelace_updated` (a dashboard was edited) — no restart needed.
//
// Runs in two modes (auto-detected):
//   * HA add-on  — reads /data/options.json, uses SUPERVISOR_TOKEN via the supervisor
//                  proxy for the allowlist precompute, proxies to http://homeassistant:8123.
//   * dev/CLI    — reads env vars, uses HA_TOKEN against HA_BASE directly.
//
// Env (dev): HA_TOKEN, HA_BASE (default http://homeassistant.mgmt:8123), PORT (8099),
//   DASH_PATHS (comma/newline list), ALWAYS_FORWARD, NEVER_FORWARD (literals or /regex/),
//   STRIP_ENTITIES (default 1; 0 = passthrough for A/B compare),
//   ALLOW_WS_URL / ALLOW_TOKEN (override the allowlist-precompute connection).
